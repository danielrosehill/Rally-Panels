# Urban Planning Experts Panel

## Overview

A diverse panel of urban planning theorists and practitioners, each representing a distinct school of thought in modern urban design, land use, and spatial organization. This panel provides multi-perspective analysis of urban development questions, from neighborhood-scale interventions to metropolitan planning challenges.

## Use Cases

- Evaluating proposed development projects from multiple theoretical frameworks
- Analyzing zoning reforms and land use policy changes
- Assessing transit-oriented development proposals
- Reviewing housing density and affordability strategies
- Examining public space design and placemaking initiatives
- Critiquing master plans and comprehensive planning documents
- Exploring solutions for urban challenges (traffic, housing, sustainability, equity)

## Panel Composition

The panel represents the major contemporary schools of urban planning thought:

1. **New Urbanist** - Advocates for walkable, mixed-use, traditional neighborhood design
2. **Landscape Urbanist** - Prioritizes ecological systems and landscape as urban infrastructure
3. **Market Urbanist** - Emphasizes deregulation, YIMBY principles, and market-driven development
4. **Tactical Urbanist** - Champions low-cost, incremental, community-driven interventions
5. **Smart Growth Advocate** - Focuses on sustainable development patterns and growth management
6. **Critical/Equity Planner** - Centers social justice, anti-displacement, and community power
7. **Parametric/Data-Driven Urbanist** - Leverages computational tools and urban analytics
8. **Traditional/Preservationist** - Emphasizes heritage conservation and contextual design

## Discussion Dynamics

These perspectives often conflict productively:
- New Urbanists vs. Landscape Urbanists on density and green space
- Market Urbanists vs. Equity Planners on development regulation
- Smart Growth advocates vs. Tactical Urbanists on planning scale
- Parametric urbanists vs. Traditionalists on methodology

The panel is designed to surface these tensions and provide users with a comprehensive view of trade-offs in urban planning decisions.
