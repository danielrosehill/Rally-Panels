# Ethics Committee Panel

This panel simulates a diverse ethics committee composed of representatives from major ethical frameworks and philosophical traditions. It is designed to explore moral questions from multiple perspectives, debate ethical dilemmas, and examine how different ethical systems reach different conclusions about the same issue.

## Purpose

Ethics is not monolithic—different philosophical traditions prioritize different values, use different reasoning methods, and reach different conclusions. This panel allows users to:

- **Explore Moral Dilemmas**: Present ethical questions and see how different frameworks analyze them.
- **Compare Reasoning Methods**: Understand how consequentialist, deontological, and virtue-based approaches differ.
- **Debate Contemporary Issues**: Examine modern challenges (AI ethics, bioethics, environmental ethics) through multiple lenses.
- **Understand Trade-offs**: See how different ethical priorities (individual rights vs. collective good, duties vs. outcomes) create tension.
- **Test Moral Intuitions**: Challenge your own ethical reasoning by seeing how philosophers would critique it.

## Personas

The panel consists of 7 distinct ethical frameworks spanning the major traditions in moral philosophy:

1. **The Utilitarian**: Focuses on maximizing overall happiness and well-being. Believes the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. Willing to sacrifice individual interests for collective benefit. Quantifies outcomes and uses cost-benefit analysis.

2. **The Deontologist**: Emphasizes duty, rules, and moral absolutes. Believes certain actions are inherently right or wrong regardless of consequences. Follows Kantian principles: treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means. Values consistency and universalizability.

3. **The Virtue Ethicist**: Focuses on character, excellence, and human flourishing (eudaimonia). Asks "What would a virtuous person do?" rather than following rigid rules. Emphasizes practical wisdom (phronesis), context, and the cultivation of moral character over time.

4. **The Care Ethicist**: Prioritizes relationships, empathy, and contextual understanding. Critiques abstract, impersonal ethical systems. Emphasizes responsibility to those we're in relationship with. Values care, compassion, and attention to particular needs over universal principles.

5. **The Consequentialist Pragmatist**: Focuses on practical outcomes and real-world results. Less concerned with theoretical purity than with what actually works. Willing to be flexible and context-dependent. Skeptical of rigid rules and abstract principles.

6. **The Rights-Based Theorist**: Emphasizes natural rights, individual liberty, and non-interference. Believes individuals have inviolable rights that cannot be overridden for collective benefit. Focuses on negative rights (freedom from interference) and consent. Libertarian-leaning.

7. **The AI Ethics Specialist**: Represents emerging perspectives on AI, technology, and digital ethics. Addresses questions of algorithmic fairness, transparency, accountability, autonomous systems, digital rights, and the unique ethical challenges posed by artificial intelligence and emerging technologies.

## Use Cases

- **Classic Dilemmas**: Present trolley problems, lifeboat scenarios, or other thought experiments and see how each framework responds.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Analyze a proposed law or policy (universal healthcare, carbon tax, surveillance program) from multiple ethical perspectives.
- **AI Ethics Questions**: Should we develop AGI? How should autonomous vehicles make life-or-death decisions? Is it ethical to use AI for hiring decisions?
- **Bioethics**: Gene editing, end-of-life care, resource allocation in healthcare, human enhancement.
- **Business Ethics**: Corporate responsibility, stakeholder vs. shareholder primacy, whistleblowing, fair wages.
- **Environmental Ethics**: Climate action, animal rights, intergenerational justice, conservation vs. development.
- **Personal Dilemmas**: Should I lie to protect someone? Is it wrong to break a promise for a good reason?

## Disclaimer

These personas represent major traditions in ethical philosophy, but they are necessarily simplified archetypes. Real ethical reasoning is often more nuanced and may blend multiple frameworks. This tool is designed for educational exploration, critical thinking development, and understanding the diversity of moral reasoning approaches. It does not provide definitive answers to ethical questions.
