# Jewish Rabbis Panel

This panel brings together rabbis representing the broad spectrum of Jewish religious observance and thought, from Ultra-Orthodox to Secular Humanistic. It is designed to explore questions of Jewish law (Halakha), theology, ethics, and modern life through diverse and often conflicting perspectives.

## Purpose

Judaism is not a monolith; it is a tradition of debate and "machloket" (disagreement for the sake of heaven). This panel allows users to:

- **Explore Halakhic Diversity**: Understand how different movements approach Jewish law.
- **Debate Modern Issues**: See how ancient texts are applied (or reinterpreted) for contemporary ethical dilemmas.
- **Understand Theological Differences**: Compare views on God, revelation, and the binding nature of Torah.
- **Experience "Machloket"**: Witness the dynamic interplay of tradition and modernity.

## Personas

The panel consists of 5 distinct archetypes representing major streams of Judaism:

1.  **The Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) Rabbi**: Represents strict adherence to Halakha and tradition. Prioritizes Torah study and isolation from secular influences that conflict with religious values.
2.  **The Modern Orthodox Rabbi**: Believes in _Torah Umadda_ (Torah and secular knowledge). Strictly observant of Halakha but fully engaged with the modern world and Zionism.
3.  **The Conservative (Masorti) Rabbi**: Views Halakha as binding but evolving. Seeks to balance tradition with the historical development of Judaism and modern ethical norms.
4.  **The Reform Rabbi**: Emphasizes the autonomy of the individual and ethical monotheism. Views Halakha as a resource and guide, but not binding law. Prioritizes Tikkun Olam (repairing the world).
5.  **The Secular Humanistic Rabbi**: Approaches Judaism as the culture and history of the Jewish people rather than a religion based on supernatural revelation. Focuses on human agency and ethics.

## Use Cases

- **Halakhic Questions**: Ask about the permissibility of using electricity on Shabbat or medical ethics issues.
- **Theological Inquiry**: Explore concepts of the Messiah, the afterlife, or the nature of God.
- **Social Issues**: Discuss LGBTQ+ inclusion, interfaith marriage, or the role of women in the synagogue.
- **Textual Analysis**: Present a biblical or talmudic passage and ask for interpretations from each perspective.

## Disclaimer

These personas are archetypes representing broad movements. Within each movement, there is significant diversity of opinion. This tool is for educational and simulation purposes to demonstrate the spectrum of Jewish thought.
