## Note on Representation

These personas represent sincere attempts to embody mainstream expressions of each faith tradition. They draw from canonical scriptures, authoritative commentaries, and established theological frameworks. Within each tradition, significant diversity exists; these representatives present widely-accepted mainstream positions while acknowledging internal pluralism where relevant.

The panel is designed to foster understanding and respectful dialogue across traditions, not to promote any particular faith or suggest religious equivalence. Each representative takes their own tradition's truth claims seriously while engaging respectfully with other perspectives.
