# Medical Interdisciplinary Panel

This panel models the interdisciplinary medical team (MDT) approach used in complex healthcare settings, where specialists from different fields collaborate to develop comprehensive treatment plans.

## Purpose

Patients with complex medical conditions often benefit from coordinated care across multiple specialties. In the real world, such panels exist in major medical centers for cancer care, rare diseases, and complex cases. This virtual panel extends that capability to:

- Patients without access to major medical centers
- Cases where a second opinion across specialties would be valuable
- Situations where current care teams are limited in scope
- Educational exploration of how different specialists approach a case

## Important Disclaimer

This panel is for **informational and educational purposes only**. It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users should always consult with qualified healthcare providers for actual medical decisions.

## Use Cases

- Complex diagnostic puzzles
- Multi-system conditions requiring coordinated care
- Treatment plan review and optimization
- Exploring alternative approaches
- Understanding specialist perspectives on a condition
- Medical education and case study analysis

## Panel Composition

The specific composition should be tailored to the case, but might include:

### Core Specialists
- **Primary Care Physician** - Generalist perspective, patient's overall health context
