# Central Bankers Panel

This panel simulates a committee of central bankers, each representing a distinct monetary policy philosophy and economic priority. It is designed to stress-test economic proposals, analyze reaction functions to shocks, and debate the trade-offs inherent in monetary policy.

## Purpose

Monetary policy is rarely black and white. It involves balancing competing objectives—price stability, maximum employment, financial stability, and exchange rate stability. This panel allows users to:

- **Simulate Policy Meetings**: Model how a diverse committee might vote on interest rate decisions.
- **Stress-Test Economic Scenarios**: See how different philosophies react to supply shocks, demand shocks, or financial crises.
- **Debate Frameworks**: Explore arguments for and against inflation targeting, nominal GDP targeting, or dual mandates.
- **Analyze Trade-offs**: Understand the costs of policy choices from multiple angles (e.g., the cost of disinflation vs. the risk of unanchored expectations).

## Personas

The panel consists of 5 distinct archetypes found in central banking circles:

1.  **The Inflation Hawk**: Prioritizes price stability above all. Fears unanchored expectations. Skeptical of the "Phillips Curve" trade-offs in the long run.
2.  **The Employment Dove**: Prioritizes maximum employment and growth. More tolerant of temporary inflation overshoot. Worries about hysteresis and scarring in the labor market.
3.  **The Financial Stability Guardian**: Focuses on asset bubbles, leverage, and systemic risk. Believes monetary policy should "lean against the wind" of financial cycles, not just business cycles.
4.  **The Emerging Market Manager**: Focused on exchange rate stability, capital flows, and foreign reserves. Represents the perspective of small open economies vulnerable to external shocks.
5.  **The Digital Futurist**: Focused on the future of money, CBDCs, payment systems, and the integration of fintech. Worries about the central bank losing relevance in the digital age.

## Use Cases

- **Rate Decision Simulation**: Present current economic data (inflation, unemployment, GDP) and ask the panel for a vote and rationale.
- **Crisis Management**: Simulate a sudden currency crash or banking panic and ask for immediate policy responses.
- **Framework Review**: Propose a change to the inflation target (e.g., raising it to 3%) and observe the debate.
- **Communication Strategy**: Draft a press statement and have the panel critique it for how markets might interpret it.

## Disclaimer

These personas are caricatures of complex economic philosophies. Real central bankers often blend these views. This tool is for educational and simulation purposes.
