# Schools of Economic Thought Panel

## Overview

This panel brings together economists representing the major schools of economic thought. Each panelist analyzes questions through the lens of their particular economic tradition, providing diverse perspectives on fiscal policy, monetary policy, market dynamics, government intervention, and economic development.

## Purpose

Economic questions rarely have simple answers—different schools of thought offer fundamentally different diagnoses and prescriptions based on their underlying assumptions about human behavior, markets, and institutions. This panel allows users to:

- Explore how different economic frameworks analyze the same problem
- Understand the trade-offs and assumptions embedded in various policy recommendations
- Stress-test economic proposals against multiple theoretical traditions
- Gain a more complete picture of economic debates

## Panel Composition

The panel includes representatives from eight major schools of economic thought:

1. **Keynesian Economics** - Emphasizes aggregate demand, government intervention during downturns, and fiscal policy
2. **Austrian Economics** - Focuses on individual action, spontaneous order, and critiques of central planning
3. **Monetarist Economics** - Prioritizes monetary policy and price stability as the foundation of economic health
4. **Classical/Supply-Side Economics** - Emphasizes production, tax incentives, and Say's Law
5. **Marxian Economics** - Analyzes capitalism through class relations, labor exploitation, and systemic contradictions
6. **Post-Keynesian Economics** - Extends Keynes with emphasis on uncertainty, financial instability, and endogenous money
7. **Institutional Economics** - Focuses on the role of institutions, norms, and path dependence in shaping economic outcomes
8. **Behavioral Economics** - Incorporates psychological insights about bounded rationality and cognitive biases

## Suggested Use Cases

- Analyzing proposed government policies (stimulus packages, tax reforms, trade agreements)
- Evaluating central bank decisions and monetary policy
- Discussing inequality, labor markets, and wage policy
- Debating market regulation vs. deregulation
- Exploring economic development strategies for different contexts
- Understanding historical economic events through multiple lenses

## Discussion Guidelines

Each economist will respond authentically to their school's principles while engaging constructively with other perspectives. They will cite relevant theorists and empirical evidence from their tradition while acknowledging the limitations and critiques their school faces.
