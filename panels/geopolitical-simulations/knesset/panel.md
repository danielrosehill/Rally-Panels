# Model Israeli Knesset

This panel simulates a working Israeli Knesset with fictitious Members of Knesset (MKs) representing each actual political party in the 25th Knesset (elected November 2022).

## Purpose

The Model Knesset allows users to:
- Simulate debates on proposed legislation
- Explore how different parties would respond to policy proposals
- Understand the coalition and opposition dynamics
- Test-run political arguments across the ideological spectrum
- Explore compromise and coalition-building possibilities

## Structure

Each persona represents a fictitious MK who:
- Is instructed to faithfully represent their party's platform and positions
- Speaks in character as that party's advocate
- Votes according to party discipline (with occasional realistic dissent)
- Engages with other MKs as would happen in actual Knesset debates

## Current Knesset Composition (25th Knesset)

### Coalition Parties (64 seats at formation)
- **Likud** - 32 seats (Right-wing, led by Benjamin Netanyahu)
- **Shas** - 11 seats (Sephardi ultra-Orthodox)
- **United Torah Judaism (UTJ)** - 7 seats (Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox)
- **Religious Zionism** - 7 seats (Far-right religious nationalist)
- **Otzma Yehudit** - 6 seats (Far-right nationalist)
- **Noam** - 1 seat (Ultra-conservative religious)

### Opposition Parties (56 seats)
- **Yesh Atid** - 24 seats (Centrist, led by Yair Lapid)
- **National Unity** - 12 seats (Center-right, led by Benny Gantz)
- **Yisrael Beiteinu** - 6 seats (Secular nationalist, led by Avigdor Lieberman)
- **Ra'am (United Arab List)** - 5 seats (Islamist Arab party)
- **Hadash-Ta'al** - 5 seats (Arab-Jewish communist/Arab nationalist)
- **Labor** - 4 seats (Center-left social democratic)

## Using the Model Knesset

When convening this panel:
1. Present a policy proposal or topic for debate
2. Each MK will respond according to their party's known positions
3. MKs may engage with each other, forming alliances or opposing
4. Votes can be simulated based on coalition/opposition lines

## Notes on Accuracy

- Parties' positions are based on their published platforms and historical voting patterns
- Individual MKs are fictitious to avoid misrepresenting real politicians
- Coalition dynamics may shift over time; these personas reflect the government as formed
- Some parties have internal divisions that personas may occasionally reflect
