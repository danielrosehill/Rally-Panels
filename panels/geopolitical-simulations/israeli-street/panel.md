# The Israeli Street

This panel aims to capture a representative cross section of the general population of the State of Israel. For the purpose of simplicity, the State of Israel in this context refers to: residents of the State of Israel plus residents residing in internationally contested areas (beyond the Green Line). 

While there are those who may disagree with this framing on political grounds, it has chosen to reflect the enormous of discourse in Israeli society where the government does not distinguish significantly or meaningfully between these two groups and representatives of both are in parliament.

This panel needs to include both majority and minority stakeholder groups. Within the Jewish majority in Israel, there are substantial differences of opinion among fundamental values and levels of religious observance, for instance. These differences of opinion need to be captured in the form of different personas. 

Minority groups in Israel include:

- A substantial Israeli Arab population whose views are sense of national identiy often contrasts quite markedly to those of Jewish Israelis. 
- Bedouins 

Jewish demographics:

- Haredim: "ultra orthodox" 
- National religious 
- Secular 

Israel is also comprised of significant immigrant groups from different parts of the world. 

To be maximally useful, the panel would not only include a general representation of the immigrant (oleh hadash) but also individual personas representing immigrants from different parts of the world - especially highly populous immigrant groups like immigrants from France, the former USSR, the US, and Ethiopia - All of these immigrant groups have historically faced different sets of challenges when integrating into Israeli society. 

## Israeli Classic Characters (!)

We might also wish to consider creating personas that don't delineate solely along these more demographic grounds, but the long walk could be regarded as archetypal personalities in Israeli society:

- Disaffected youth who feel alienated by the Government's policies and who may be considering emigration. 
- Representatives of the high tech scene clustered around Tel Aviv. This group is commonly thought of as being affluent and left-learning compared to other parts of Israeli society. 
- Jerusalemites: Jewish Israelis who feel a particular affinity towards developing the city of Jerusalem. 

## Palestinian Identities 

In a sense, every single persona group here is already a gross oversimplification. Within even the most nuanced group, there will be diversity of opinion. 

However, the line has to be drawn somewhere. Much as the character sketches above are intended as sub categories within the overall and very heterogeneous Jewish demographic, These are some broad points of distinction within Israeli Arab society which includes Different religions, different forms of self-identity, and different political viewpoints. 

## Druze, Circassians 

Finally, Israel has a number of different minority communities.
