# Population of Jerusalem

This panel represents the highly fractured geopolitical and demographic landscape of Jerusalem - a city where decision-making and policy implementation face unique challenges due to the diversity of its population and competing visions for the city's future.

## Purpose

Jerusalem is unlike any other city in Israel (or perhaps the world). Its population includes:
- Ultra-Orthodox Jews who form a large and growing percentage of the Jewish population
- A minority of secular Jews who often feel like strangers in their own city
- Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem with a complex legal status
- Various Christian communities with deep historical roots
- Competing claims to religious sites and neighborhoods

This panel convenes perspectives from these different groups to evaluate policy proposals, urban development plans, and decisions affecting Jerusalem's daily life and future.

## Use Cases

- Municipal policy evaluation
- Urban planning and development proposals
- Public transportation and Shabbat observance tensions
- Housing and neighborhood development
- Religious site access and management
- East Jerusalem status and services
- Cultural and educational policy

## Panel Composition

The panel should include personas representing:

### Jewish Demographics
- **Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi)** - The largest and fastest-growing Jewish demographic in Jerusalem
- **National Religious** - Committed to Jerusalem's Jewish character and development

### Arab Demographics

- **Christian Arab** - Representatives of ancient Christian communities

### Special Perspectives

## Key Tensions to Explore

- Public Shabbat observance vs. secular freedom of movement
